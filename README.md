## 🧩 Overview  

**Audio Hijack for macOS** is a professional-grade sound recording and routing utility that lets you take full control of your Mac’s audio environment. Perfect for podcasters, broadcasters, musicians, and streamers, it provides a visual and modular approach to capturing, processing, and enhancing sound.  

Instead of traditional recorders, **Audio Hijack** gives you a **block-based workflow**, where you connect sources, effects, and outputs like building a sound circuit. Capture music from apps, record microphone input, or combine multiple sources into one high-quality file — all in real time.  

With a comprehensive library of **audio effects**, including equalizers, compressors, and noise filters, you can clean up and fine-tune recordings instantly. Built-in scheduling and automation features make it easy to start recording sessions at specific times or trigger actions when certain apps open.  

Engineered for **Apple Silicon**, Audio Hijack delivers near-zero latency, smooth real-time processing, and exceptional efficiency — all within an elegant macOS-native design. Whether for production, streaming, or professional audio work, it’s a must-have utility for precision sound control.
